# Building an Accordion
_To complete this test, you are expected to build an accordion to match the below steps as closely as possible._

## Steps
1. A design for the accordion has been drawn up and is included in this folder called accordion-design.png.

2. The HTML markup for the accordion has been written for you in the index.html file.

3. Your task is to write the CSS and vanilla Javascript (no Bootstrap, jQuery or any other dependencies) for the accordion so that it looks like the design and works as expected.

4. It should work like a traditional accordion, opening and closing the text areas when you click on the section titles. Only one text area should be open at a time.

5. Please add an animation to the opening and closing of the text areas of your choosing.

## Notes:
- The font being used in the design is Helvetica Neue. The section titles are of a medium font weight and the text areas are a light font weight.
- We're not particularly fussy about this being pixel perfect (it was a very rough design), just try and make it look like the design to the naked eye.
- There are bonus points available for responsive css, but this is not required.
- This will be tested only in the latest version of Chrome - backwards compatibility is not required (although bonus points are available if it is).
